# FInal Project
This is my Final Project
***
It is a guess the jumbled up word or phrase game. The user starts by selecting words or phrases in the JComboBox and then presses the start game button. The game will display a jumbled up version of the word or phrase in the text area.
***
There is also a timer fucntion in the game. There is a JCheckbox that the user can select to turn on/off the timer. The timer is a 1 minute countdown. The user can enable this to increase the difficutly.
***
There is a hint option for the user to select. When pressed it will display the first letter of the word or the first 2 letters of the phrase (since a phrase is harder). When the hint button is pressed again it will display the next letter of the word or the next 2 letters of the phrase etc..
***
Lastly, the user inputs their guess in the bottom area and then hits submit. It will display whether the user is correct or incorrect. If correct the score will be updated in the top right corner. It will then display another word or phrase (Whichever was selected). The user can change to word or phrase again and hit start game to try a different word or phrase.
